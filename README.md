# Udacity-DataEngineer-Data-Pipline-With-Airflow
The project is to use Airflow for data pipline, which includes creating custom operators to perform tasks such as staging the data, filling the data warehouse, and running data quanlity checks on the data as the final step.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.
